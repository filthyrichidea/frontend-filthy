                Why Use a Registered Agent Service?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.tagline}>
                Registered Agent services like the one offered by Filthy Rich Idea help
                you avoid the hassles and inconvenience of managing all of your
                own documentation from the state.
                <br />
                <br />
                They also help preserve your privacy by setting up a
                public-facing address for your business that is separate from
                your home.
                <br />
                <br />
                When you use a Registered Agent service, any official legal or
                tax correspondence will be forwarded to your personal, private
                contact address. Filthy Rich Ideaâ€™s Registered Agent service also helps
                you stay on top of deadlines (such as required annual reports)
                to keep your business in good standing.
                <br />
                <br />A good Registered Agent service can help you respond
                quickly in the event of a lawsuit, avoid missed deadlines, fines
                and penalties for non-compliance, and otherwise manage the
                details of paperwork so you can focus on running your business.
