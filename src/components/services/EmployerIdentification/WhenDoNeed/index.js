              <p className={styles.tagline}>
                <b>Partnerships:</b> an EIN is required for all general
                partnerships and limited partnerships.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Multiple-member LLCs:</b> This type of business entity needs
                an EIN regardless of whether you have employees.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Single-member LLCs:</b> If you plan to hire employees within
                the next 12 months, you will need to get an EIN. And even if
                your single-member LLC has no employees, and even if you can get
                by with using your own individual Social Security Number for tax
                purposes, itâ€™s still a good idea to get an EIN because many
                banks and lenders will prefer to use an EIN to do business with
                you.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>LLC taxed as a Corporation:</b> If your LLC chooses to be
                taxed as a Corporation (for example, by electing to be treated
                as an S-Corporation for tax purposes), you will need to get an
                EIN.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Sole proprietorship with employees:</b> Even if you do not
                have an LLC or any other legal entity for your business and you
                run a simple sole proprietorship, you still need to get an EIN
                if you have employees or plan to hire employees in the next 12
                months.
