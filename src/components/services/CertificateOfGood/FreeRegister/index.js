                After you form your LLC or corporation, it’s important to stay
                up-to-date on filing your annual report, biennial report or
                other required forms and compliance paperwork. To stay in good
                standing, your business needs to meet a few key requirements,
                depending on your company’s home state. These typically include:
                <br />
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Being up-to-date on annual or biennial fees to the Secretary
                    of State to register or renew your business
                  </li>
                  <li>Filing annual or biennial reports</li>
                  <li>
                    Paying any other necessary business fees or franchise taxes
                    to state regulators
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                To get a Certificate of Good Standing, you’ll need to file the
                appropriate form with your state, or Incfile can do it for you.
