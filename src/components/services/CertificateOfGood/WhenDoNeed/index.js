                In certain situations, you may be required to prove that your
                business exists and is in compliance with relevant laws and
                regulations. A Certificate of Good Standing from your state
                serves as this proof.
                <br />
                <br />
                Different authorities may require a Certificate of Good
                Standing, including:
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Other state governments:</b> as part of the process of
                applying for Foreign Qualification for your business to register
                to do business in states other than your home state
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Lenders or banks:</b> that want to get proof of your
                businessâ€™s existence and business history as part of evaluating
                your creditworthiness for a loan or when carrying out certain
                types of transactions
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Investors or business partners:</b> who want to make sure
                your business is legitimate and in compliance with laws and
                regulations
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>More capital:</b> C Corps are typically much more attractive
                to potential investors, like venture capitalists and
                shareholders, because this type of business structure allows for
                wider ownership of the corporation.
