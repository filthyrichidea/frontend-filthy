          <p>
            Our service fee to change the agent is $49. You'll also need to pay
            the state fee, which varies based on where your business was formed.
            To review the fee in your state click on the “order now” button and
            select the state and entity type.

          <p>
            No! We pride ourselves on transparency. There are absolutely no
            hidden costs associated with you changing your Registered Agent.

            You’ll always need to fill out a “Change of Registered Agent” form,
            but the processing fee and the information needed varies by state -
            which is why it pays to work with Incfile. Check out everything you
            need to know about Registered Agents and make sure to explore your
            state’s specific information.
